# fastged

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of fastged is to provide a fast implementation for gene expression discretization. It uses gaussian mixture modeling on the estimated signal density curve for determining the tresholds.

The gene expression discretization uses either binary classification (values 0,1) corresponding to expressed and non-expressed genes respectively or 3 classes (values -1, 0, 1) corresponding to non-expressed, normally expressed and highly expressed genes.

## Installation

You can install the released version of fastged from GitHub with:

``` r
install_github("LrRmpf/fastged")
```

## How to use?

An input file containing a gene expression matrix (Rows: Gene IDs, Columns: Sample IDs) has to be specified in console command. The other arguments are optional. Run Rscript discretization.R with option -h to show all options:

    Rscript <Path to discretization.R> -h
    
Console output:    

    Options:
          -f CHARACTER, --file=CHARACTER
                  dataset file name

          -p, --plot
                  Should the program plot the resulting densities of each sample? [default FALSE]

          -b, --binary
                  Should the program's output be a binary classification? [default FALSE]

          -o CHARACTER, --out=CHARACTER
                  output file name [default= NA]

          -h, --help
                  Show this help message and exit

Example commands: 

        Rscript <Path to discretization.R> -f <Path to input file>

        Rscript <Path to discretization.R> -f <Path to input file> -p

        Rscript <Path to discretization.R> -f <Path to input file> -p -b
        
        Rscript <Path to discretization.R> -f <Path to input file> -p -o <Path to output file + filename>
        

If -p or --plot is chosen the plots are saved to the folder "/.fastged/Plots".

The binary classification is chosen with -b --binary.

A name an location for the output file containing the discretized matrix can be chosen with -o or --out. If none is specified the file is saved to "/.fastged/GDE/gde.txt".
